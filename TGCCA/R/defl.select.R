# @param rr  A list that contains the residual matrices \eqn{X_{1h}, \ldots, X_{Jh}}
# @param nncomp A \eqn{1 \times J} vector that contains the number of components to compute for each block.
# @param nn  A \eqn{1 \times J} vector that contains the numbers of deflations for each block
# @param nbloc Number of blocks.
