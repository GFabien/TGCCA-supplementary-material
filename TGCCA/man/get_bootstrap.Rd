\arguments{
\item{b}{A fitted bootstrap object (see  \code{\link[RGCCA]{bootstrap}} )}

\item{comp}{An integer giving the index of the analysis components}

\item{block}{A vector indicating the blocks to consider.}

\item{bars}{Character string giving the variability among "sd" (error bar of
standard deviation) , "stderr" (error bar of standard deviation divided by
sqrt(n)) or "quantile" (error bar of 0.05/0.95-quantiles)}

\item{collapse}{A boolean to combine the variables of each block as result}

\item{n_cores}{Number of cores for parallelization}

\item{display_order}{A logical value to display the order of the variables}

\item{adj.method}{character string indicating the method used for p-value
adjustment (default: fdr - a.k.a Benjamini-Hochberg correction)}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing:
\itemize{
\item 'mean' for the mean of the bootstrap weights (non-null for SGCCA)
\item 'estimate' for RGCCA weights
\item 'sd' for the standard error of the (non-null in case of SGCCA)
bootstrap weights
\item 'lower/upper_bound' for the lower and upper intervals calculated
according to the 'bars' parameter
\item 'bootstrap_ratio' for the mean of the bootstrap weights / their
standard error
\item 'pval' for p-value (see details)
\item 'adjust.pval' for adjusted p-value (default value: fdr (Benjamini-
Hochberg correction))
\item 'occurrences' for non-zero occurences (for SGCCA)
\item 'sign' for significant ('*') or not ('ns') p-value (alpha = 0.05)
(see details)

\description{
This function extracts statistical information from a fitted bootstrap
object. (\code{\link[RGCCA]{bootstrap}})
}
\details{
For RGCCA, a classical Student test (df = number of bootstraps -1) is
computed based on the following statistic : weight/bootstrap estimate of
the standard deviations.
By including sparsity (with "sgcca","spls" or "spca"), the frequency of a
selected variable may depend on both the level of sparsity and the total
number of variables in each block.
For a random selection of the variable within the block, the number of
occurrences (0 or 1) follows a Bernoulli distribution with the parameter
p = proportion of selected variables in the block.
This proportion is estimated by the average number of selected variables
over all bootstraps divided by the total number of variables in each block
(p_j). On a larger number of bootstrap samples, the number of occurrences
follows a binomial distribution B(n,p) with n=number of bootstraps.
The test is based on the following null hypothesis: "the variable is
randomly selected according to B(n,p)". This hypothesis is rejected when
the number of occurrences is higher than the 1-(0.05/p_j)th quantile
