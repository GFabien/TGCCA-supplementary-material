\title{Create either a superblock design matrix (if superblock = TRUE), or a
supervised design matrix (if response != NULL) or a fully connected design
matrix (if response == NULL and superblock == FALSE)}

}
\arguments{
\item{blocks}{A list that contains the J blocks of variables X1, X2, ..., XJ.
Block Xj is a matrix of dimension n x p_j where p_j is the number of
variables in X_j.}

\item{superblock}{Boolean indicating the presence of the superblock.
Default = TRUE}

\item{response}{Position of the response block}
}
\value{
A binary design matrix encoding the connection between the blocks
}
